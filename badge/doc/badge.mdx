# Badge

Badges are small status descriptors for UI elements. A badge consists of a small circle, typically containing a number or other short set of characters, that appears in proximity to another object.

## Usage

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Badge } from '@divriots/starter-origami/badge';

const MyComponent = () => <Badge>3</Badge>;
```

<Playground
  scope={{ Badge }}
  code={`<Badge style={{width: '1rem'}}>3</Badge>`}
/>
