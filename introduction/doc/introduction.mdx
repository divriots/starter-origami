Origami is a [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev) Design System starter kit, using [Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com) component library: an open source components library based on [Material Design](https://material.io/design).

## Features

- Open-source
- Cross-platform: Mobile & Web
- 25+ components
- Interactive documentation
- Light & Dark mode

## Design Tokens

Origami takes the design tokens defined in [Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com).

- Colors
- Fonts
- Roundness
- Animation

And make them automatically documented and visually discoverable.

<ThemeColorsShowcase />

[Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com) has great semantical design tokens. It's simple but very efficient. The Paper team has done a great job here.

## Dark mode

Dark and Light themes are included out-of-the-box. You can experience it in the documentation itself.

## Components

Origami comes with 25+ components to get started: menu, dialog, buttons, checkbox, cards, everything to cover the basics, and more.
